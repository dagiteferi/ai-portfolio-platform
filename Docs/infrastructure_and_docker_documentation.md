## 1. Introduction

The infrastructure for the AI Portfolio Chatbot is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and easy to deploy. It leverages Docker and Docker Compose to create a containerized environment that can be deployed consistently across different environments. This documentation will walk you through the key components of the infrastructure and explain how they work together.

## 2. Core Technologies

This section provides an overview of the core technologies used in the project's infrastructure.

### Docker

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. It allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a single, isolated container that can be run on any machine with Docker installed. This ensures that your application runs consistently across different environments, from development to production.

### Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to configure your application's services, networks, and volumes. With a single command, you can start, stop, and manage all the services in your application.

### Nginx

Nginx is a high-performance web server, reverse proxy, and load balancer. In this project, Nginx is used as a reverse proxy to route traffic to the appropriate backend service. It also serves the static files for the frontend application.

### Gunicorn

Gunicorn is a Python WSGI HTTP server for UNIX. It is a pre-fork worker model, which means that it spawns multiple worker processes to handle incoming requests. This makes it a good choice for running production-grade Python web applications.

## 3. Infrastructure Overview

The infrastructure for the AI Portfolio Chatbot consists of two main services:

*   **Backend:** A FastAPI application that provides the core AI and chat functionality.
*   **Frontend:** A React application that provides the user interface for the chatbot.

These services are orchestrated using Docker Compose, which defines how they are built, configured, and run. Nginx is used as a reverse proxy to route traffic to the appropriate service.

## 4. Containerization Strategy

This section explains how the backend and frontend applications are containerized using Docker.

### Backend Dockerfile

The `backend/Dockerfile` is a multi-stage Dockerfile that builds and runs the backend application.

*   **Stage 1: Builder:** This stage installs the build dependencies and builds the Python wheels for the application. This helps to reduce the size of the final image and improve build times.
*   **Stage 2: Production Image:** This stage copies the pre-built wheels from the builder stage and installs them. It then copies the application code and sets the appropriate permissions. Finally, it starts the application using Gunicorn.

### Frontend Dockerfile

The `frontend/Dockerfile` is a multi-stage Dockerfile that builds and runs the frontend application.

*   **Stage 1: Build:** This stage installs the dependencies and builds the React application for production.
*   **Stage 2: Serve:** This stage copies the build output from the build stage and serves it using Nginx.

## 5. Deployment Process

This section explains how to deploy the AI Portfolio Chatbot.

### Deployment Script

The `infrastructure/scripts/deploy.sh` script is the recommended way to deploy the application. It automates the process of building and starting the Docker containers.

To deploy the application, run the following command from the project's root directory:

```bash
./infrastructure/scripts/deploy.sh
```

To stop and remove the containers, run the following command:

```bash
./infrastructure/scripts/deploy.sh down
```

### Manual Deployment

You can also deploy the application manually using Docker Compose.

To build and start the containers, run the following command from the project's root directory:

```bash
docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml up --build -d
```

To stop and remove the containers, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml down
```

## 6. Configuration

This section explains how to configure the different components of the infrastructure.

### Nginx Configuration

The Nginx configuration is located in the `infrastructure/nginx/config.conf` file. It defines how Nginx routes traffic to the backend and frontend services.

*   The `location /` block serves the static files for the frontend application.
*   The `location /api/` block proxies requests to the backend service.

### Gunicorn Configuration

The Gunicorn configuration is located in the `gunicorn_config.py` file. It defines the number of worker processes and threads to use, as well as the host and port to bind to.

## 7. Future Improvements

This section outlines potential improvements that could be made to the infrastructure.

*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the testing and deployment process.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement a monitoring and logging solution to track the health and performance of the application.
*   **Scalability:** Improve the scalability of the application by using a load balancer and a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes.
